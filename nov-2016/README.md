-# Cardiff Go Meetup's November Code Dojo Exercise
-
-We were tasked with making some kind of rest API that consumed other rest APIs and then split up into groups.
-
-Our team decided we would:
- 
-* Set up a web server that would:
-    * get a picture from the Cat api
-    * Convert it to ascii
-    * Upload it to github as an anonymous gist
-    * redirect the user to one of the above gists on every request
- 
-On the night, just before demonstrating the app I managed to delete the source code with git. I have reconstructed the code here for posterity.

-* _Ascii code based on: https://github.com/stdupp/goasciiart_
